# Developing Data Products - Johns Hopkins University on Coursera
## Assignment: Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch
***
As part of the requirements for completing the Coursera course: Developing Data Products, part of the Data Science Specialization created by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera, students are required to create a Shiny application and to store it on an RStudioâ€™s  severr.  In addition, students are required to create a reproducible pitch presentation about the application and to publish it as a web page.

This repository on my GitHub account holds all the files that I have created and used to produce my Shiny Application and its Reproducible Pitch.
