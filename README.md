# Developing Data Products - Johns Hopkins University on Coursera
## Assignment: Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch
***
As part of the requirements for completing the Coursera course: Developing Data Products, part of the Data Science Specialization organized by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera, students are required to create a Shiny application and to store it on an RStudio’s  sever.  Secondly, students are required to create a Reproducible Pitch about the application.
This repository, on my GitHub account, holds all the files that I have created and used to produce my Shiny Application and its Reproducible Pitch.

### Course Project Description
***
My Shiny Application seeks to do some exploratory analysis based on the training set of Kaggle's Titanic dataset, which provides information on the characteristics of the RMS Titanic’s passengers <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>.   My exercise is based on the exercise presented by Trevor Stephens on his blog: “Titanic: Getting Started With R”: <http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r>.

The training dataset of Kaggle’s Titanic Challenge provides characteristic information on Titanic’s passengers.  My Shiny Application seeks to provide answers, in a comparative way, to:

*	The survivors’ sex

*	The survivors’ passenger class

*	The survivor’s age
